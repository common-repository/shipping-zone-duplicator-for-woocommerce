Tiny plugin to add Duplication features to shipping zones and methods

== Description ==
What do you want me to say? It just adds the ability to duplicate shipping zones as well as the shipping rates inside the zones :-)

== Installation ==

1. Install/activate as any other WordPress plugin.
2. No configuring or settings, just adds 'Duplicate' to the existing 'Edit' and 'Delete' actions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with Advanced Shipping? =

Yes, any [Advanced Shipping](https://aceplugins.com/plugin/advanced-shipping-for-woocommerce/purchase) rate setup in the shipping zones can be duplicated with this plugin.

= Does this work with ..? =

The plugin is tested and working with WooCommerce Core and [Advanced Shipping](https://aceplugins.com/plugin/advanced-shipping-for-woocommerce/purchase) rates. No other plugins have been tested, but they're likely to work out of the box.
